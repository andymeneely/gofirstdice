"Go First" dice genetic algorithm computation
=============================================

When playing board games, you usually have to randomly decide who goes first.  

With "Go First" dice, everyone gets one die, and rolls their own die. Every die has a different set of numbers, so there's never a tie. And here's the rub: everyone has an equal probability of going first.

I first tried to come up with one of these by hand, and got pretty close. But I figured there was a better/fun way to do find it - hence the genetic algorithm.

Setup

If you want to play with this - you're on your own. I'm using Eclipse, Java, and Maven (via the m2Eclipse plugin). Everything should be self-contained and easy to run. But hey, it's a hobby thing.
